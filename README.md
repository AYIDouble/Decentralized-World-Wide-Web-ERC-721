# 💎 Decentralized World Wide Web ERC-721 🌐
This is a decentralized **World Wide Web** implemented with an **ERC-721 Token** on the **Ethereum Blockchain**.</br>
I created this project to show, that there's another way to build the World Wide Web. </br>

## 🌐 The Purpose of a decentralized World Wide Web 🌐
- Nothing can be deleted, once it's published
- Uncensorable
- decentralized

## ❓ How it works ❓
A Website is build by **ERC-721 Tokens**, each of these Token can carry up to **100 ASCII Words (100 * 256)**

For the Moment only the HTML is being saved in these **ERC-721 Tokens**.
