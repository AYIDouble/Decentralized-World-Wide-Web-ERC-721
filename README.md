# Rho Prototype
The Rho project is still in the concept phase.

## Rho-Tor
The original idea behind Rho is to reward all users who run Tor Nodes (especially Exit Nodes) with a cryptocurrency.

## What is Rho
Rho is a cryptocurrency that can be used to publish data (ex. Website) on the Rho-Blockchain.
There is no premining to keep Rho equitable, all work is done unsalaried.

## The Purpose of Rho
- An uncensorable decentralized and free Network
- Make the Tor-Network stronger

## Technical Data
- Rho is not premined and there can be unlimited blocks
- The maximum size of one block is 10 kilobyte 
- A block gets generated each second (Each day this would be a size of maximum 0.864 GB)
- The earlier someone begins with using Rho, the more he gets in reward
